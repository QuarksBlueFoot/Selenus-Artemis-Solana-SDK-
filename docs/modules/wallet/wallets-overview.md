# Wallet integration

Artemis uses `WalletAdapter` as the normalized wallet interface.

## Adapters

- LocalSignerWalletAdapter: tests and server-side signing
- MwaWalletAdapter (Android): Mobile Wallet Adapter reference integration

Arcane features are optional and do not affect wallet integration.
